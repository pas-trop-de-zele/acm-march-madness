### Part 1

Diamond, Justin and Pillow loves running. 
Every time they run, the record which street they start on and where they finish
They have been training for a long time such that it only take them 1 foot step to clear a street!
Example:
```
Diamond ran 1 to 10
# Diamond took 1 step each for each street from 1th to 10th (inclusive)
```
The group loves to run on "prime" streets due to the flat surfaces.
Prime street are those with number being prime (2,3,5,7,etc)
For each person, what is the sum of the steps they have taken on prime streets? 
Give the max out of the 3 friends

Example:
```
Diamond ran 7 to 10
Justin ran 2 to 5
Pillow ran 1 to 7

Diamond got 1 step each on prime street 7 = 1 total
Justin got 1 step each on prime street 2, 3, 5 = 3 total
Pillow got 1 step each on prime street 2, 3, 5, 7 = 4 total

Here 4 is the answer!
